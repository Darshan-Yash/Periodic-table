Periodic Table Facts Bot – Project Goals
1. User Authentication (Login & Signup)

Allow only authenticated users to access the bot.

Simple, email-based sign-up and login system.

Passwords stored securely using hashing (pbkdf2_sha256).

Backend generates JWT tokens; frontend stores them and sends them with each request.

2. Periodic Table Element Lookup

Users can search any element by:

Symbol (H, He, Na…)

Name (Hydrogen, Helium, etc.)

The bot returns:

Atomic number

Atomic weight

Group & period

State at STP

Electron configuration

Density

This is provided by your local elements.json dataset.

3. AI-Generated Facts (Using OpenRouter API)

User asks a question like:

“Tell me a fun fact about Carbon.”

“Explain why noble gases don’t react much.”

Backend sends the question + element info to OpenRouter LLM.

LLM replies with a clean, safe, factual answer.

Only authenticated users can chat with the bot.

4. Frontend Application (Vite + React)

Modern, simple UI built with Vite + React.

Pages:

Login

Signup

Home / Chat

Element Browser (optional)

Chat interface similar to ChatGPT but simple:

User types a question.

Frontend sends question + token to backend.

Backend replies with the bot’s answer.

5. Backend (FastAPI)

Your backend supports:

JWT authentication (/signup, /login, /me)

Element lookup (/elements, /elements/{symbol})

AI answer endpoint (/ask) → will connect to OpenRouter

CORS enabled to allow frontend requests

Local JSON dataset (no external DB unless needed)

No deployment (entirely local project)

6. Local-Only System

No deployment required

Runs fully on your machine:

FastAPI backend → localhost:8000

React frontend → localhost:5173

Only you can create accounts (closed system)
